# German Expressionism
The early mid-19th century was marked by a sea change in the way human beings understood their place in the world. Neitzsche's declaration was an symbol of this change. Furthermore, this was reflected in the field of artistic expression by the decoupling of art from a religious understanding of the world, particularly in the popularity of the *novel*, whose novelty lay in the focus on the common person, rather than someone preordained to be great. The genre of Gothic literature, for instance, arose out of this movement. People also began to look inwards and try to understand human beings, anatomically and psychologically.

By the early 20th century, Europe was undergoing a crisis in the shape of the First World War. This was the first industrial war, marked by the use of weaps of mass destruction, and mass production of equipment. This was the backdrop of the rise of German *expressionism*, of which *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* (1920) is one of the best examples. This art form was defined by a desire to express imaginations, or interiorities (both of the body and of the mind), in opposition to physical realities. In other words, it does not rely on replication, but on the artist's own desire to express. Expressionist filmmaking, like art, was characterized by uneven and high-contrast lighting (chiaroscuro; using only a key light), and lines prominently cutting across the frame. It also frequently involved bulging eyes, impossible features, distorted sets, 

The national psyche that preceded this was an atmosphere of resentment and moral ambiguity coming out of the war. An example of expressionism that emphasizes the idea that all people have evil within them is *The Crime of M. Lange* (1936). Shadows also feature prominently in many of these works. The idea of the loss of innocence and the awareness of science is also symbolized by the vampire bite in *Nosferatu* (1922).  
The scene where Nosferatu approaches Hutter shows many elements of the expressionist set, using arches and spikes, shadows, and receding depths. It also limits the frame using a roughly circular iris.

Many of these elements continued into the genre of film noir, and persisted for a long time. For example, *The Third Man* (1949) shows many of these techniques, particularly in Orson Welle's introduction scene and the scene with the chase through the sewers.

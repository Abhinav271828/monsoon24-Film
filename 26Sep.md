# Lighting
There are several techniques of lighting in shots to create various effects. One of the common techniques is *chiaroscuro*, or the use of shadows to highlight parts of the scene. Soft focus is another technique (commonly used with heroines), which blurs out the background while keeping the main element in focus.

# Cinema and Culture
The context of cinema waves comes from the culture and politics surrounding the time and place of its production. For example, the German expressionist wave was a reaction to Fascism; the French and Italian new waves came out of World War II; and the depiction of romance in Indian cinema was derevolutionalized by globalization (compare DDLJ with *Aawara*).

The first film was made by the Lumiere brothers in the 1890s, although they saw no future in the method and sold their equipment later. George Melies is another important figure in early cinema, who made (in opposition to the Lumieres' *realities*) staged films. Two of his most famous works are *The Astronomer's Dream* and *Trip to the Moon*.

Dadasaheb Phalke brought the camera to India from London, and made the first film in the country (*Raja Harischandra*, 1913). He was an artist trained in Baroda, and also introduced to lithograph to India, which was used to make posters from art. His collaboration with Raja Ravi Varma influenced the uniform depiction of Indian deities and popularized their use in daily life (*e.g.*, in calendars, matchboxes, and so on).

# The Beginnings of Cinema
Two of the oldest films of the world are *L'Arrivee d'un train en gare de La Ciotat* (Lumiere Brothers, 1897) and *La Sortie de l'usine Lumière à Lyon* (1895). These are a testament to the massive changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution, which introduced a concept of "mass" – education, communication and production. The latter, in fact, demonstrates the dominance of women in the industrial workforce.

George Melies' contributions, on the other hand, were centred around imagination and fiction. *Le voyage a la Lune* (1902) is one such staged film, which was essentially recorded theatre. This demonstrates a lot of new techniques at the time – moving sets, dissolves, superpositions, cuts, and so on. It used the carnival attractions of the time, like gymnasts, as well.

# Neo-Realism
We will consider the post-WWII situation in Europe, particularly Italy and France. These two countries had been devastated by German occupation and Allied resistance; in Italy, the Cinecitta film studio was destroyed in the process. The US supported these countries financially, including creating film infrastructure, supporting the distribution of Hollywood. The postwar period also saw the collapse of the studio system in the US, which was the basis of the careers of actors and directors in the interwar period.

The now out-of-work directors in Italy, then, begin a movement to depict the reality of being an Italian after the war, showing poverty, rubble, shortages, and unemployment. These films capture a spirit of despair and lack of hope. This represented a break from the idealist, good-guy-wins, evil-guy-dies tradition in cinema. A canonical example is *Ladri di Biciclette* (1948, Vittorio de Sica).  
The stylistic features of neo-realism were real locations, human concerns, emotional stories and unaffected performances. They also include narratives without closures.

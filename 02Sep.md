# Человек с Киноаппаратом
The aspect of *Человек с Киноаппаратом* that stands out the most to us, as viewers, is its lack of narrative and continuity. This aspect of filmmaking has seen widely varying approaches across industries. For example, Bollywood sees the usage of intermissions and songs for this purpose – to suspend the narrative and give the viewer breaks. Other industries, like the Hong Kong industry, use specially choreographed action sequences; South Indian movies use a "comic track" running parallel to the main plot, interspersed with it.  
This affects characterization as well; the item song was used to define a "vamp" character in pre-90s Hindi cinema, characterized by westernization in dress and music, which eventually converged to the heroine in the 90s.

*Человек с Киноаппаратом* represents a time when cinema is figuring out how to build tempo, by showing a variety of unrelated scenes in quick succession and rotating between them. It also creates an eye-of-God impression in the mind of the viewer, by showing the placement of the camera in out-of-the-way places, where it can see things without being seen.

It is also a celebration of labour, being set in 1929 Soviet Russia. The hero of the movie is the man operating the movie camera, who makes the city run, who makes industry run. The multiplicity of lives and livelihoods is the central focus of the movie, setting it in opposition to the isolation and alienation of modern establishing shots of cities, featuring skylines and highrises without ever looking in.  
The awe of the rapid industrialization of the world and of the USSR is exemplified in the representation of the camera in the movie – this is coming close on the heels of the World Trade Fair in 1924, which celebrated machinery, and in particular, the camera. The stop-motion scene with the camera operating itself is a representation of this popular opinion.

# Story, Plot and Narrative
The story is an abstract description of the main crux of a work – it is what remains constant across adaptations. The plot is the series of actions and events that drive this story. The narrative is the way the plot unfolds.

First-person narration, in literature, is when the story is told by one of the characters. In cinema, this is reflected by point-of-view shots (frequently used in flashbacks or dreams). Third-person narration, in contrast, features a narrator distinct from the cast of characters, who may be objective, limited or omniscient.  
An example of the variation among styles of narration is *Chutney* (2016), which switches between the omniscient narrator of the outside story, the first-person narrator of Vanita's story, and the omniscient narrator within that story. For example, the scene with her masturbating is known only to us and her, but not to her audience; she also engineered Bhola finding out about his wife and her brother-in-law through her scheme with the box.

# Shot Composition
In Japanese houses, the entry is at the level of someone sitting slightly above ground level, around the shoulder level of a standing person. This is the level at which the camera is kept for most of the shots of the movie.  
Additionally, the shots are square and the actors look straight at it, as they are testifying. This is a theatrical form of shooting, reminiscent of many art forms (dastangoi, kabuki theatre, and the sutradhar of Indian theatre) and gives us the full force of the characters – most notably the sensuality of the dacoit.

## Camera Movement
The opening scene of *Touch of Evil* (1958) uses a long take (six-and-a-half minutes) to create a sense of tension, with the bomb appearing in the beginning and its ticking always audible to us through the music. It keeps all major players in the frame, showing us who the hero is and many other important elements.  
Another example of a long take is the shot of the studio in *The Player* (1992), which references the scene in *Touch of Evil* as well. It opens with a painting, with a woman clapping in front of the camera; this is followed by the woman having a conversation with the receptionist and running out, followed by a camera, while our camera moves away. It creates an effect of confusion and a lack of clarity, various elements coming together with recognition and misrecognition. The cut comes after the threats and photographs are shown on Tim Robbins' character's table – the cut happens at an important plot point, as in *Touch of Evil*.

The steadicam was pioneered by *The Shining*, which uses a trolley to follow the child around the hotel corridors, at the same level as the kid himself, only rising when he gets off the tricycle. Other elements of the scene, like the music and the graphic design of the carpet with red blobs, and the repetitive nature of hotel corridors, embellish the effect of fear for the viewer. The cut to the closeup of the kid's face looking at the door makes the narrator more objective.  
The difference between a handheld and a steady cam is also seen in the beach house murder scene from *Us* (2019).

# Narration
An example of narration being used to set the rhythm of the scene is the morning scene of *Apur Sansar* (1959), hanging on the word *anusuchana*; it changes the conversation from a discussion between a husband and a wife to a romantic chat, and wraps around the scene when it is mentioned again at the end.

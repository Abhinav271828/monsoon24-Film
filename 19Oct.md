# The French New Wave
The Italian neo-realist movement mostly consisted of what are called "rubble films" – the an important part of the mise-en-scene is the rubble that Italy found itself in after the war. These movies prominently feature despair and hopelessness.  
French neo-realism, or *la nouvelle vague* followed the Italian movement, but was not quite the same. France suffered petrol shortages, curfew, and light shortages, and the occupation stamped out the thriving pre-war film culture. After 1944, American films took over, and the government adopted left-leaning socio-political policies. In this context, journals like *Cahiers du Cinema* (Andre Bazin) became popular and led new practices in filmmaking.

The *auteur* theory, which ascribed the creative force behind a movie primarily to the director, was laid out in *Le Camera-Stylo* (Astruc, 1948). It expressed the idea that a movie was more than a show or a fairground attraction, but a sophisticated art form with stylistic tools capable of expressing philosophical meditations on a variety of topics. It adds the value of realism to the practices already established by German expressionism.

The French New Wave, therefore, is marked by whimsy, non-teleological storytelling, without a conclusion or a neatly wrapped-up ending. It shattered the escapist illusion of the conclusive, neat, ordered stories that made up cinema. Some of its prominent features were direct sound, available light, handheld cameras and location shooting. Jump cuts also characterized these films. The New Wave also travelled beyond Europe, as film culture had become a global phenomenon at this point – Satyajit Ray was the most successful example of this in India. Each country's new wave, described as the "art film movement," consisted universally of movies not directed towards the box office.

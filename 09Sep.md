# Narrative
Every story has a beginning, middle, and end. In general, it can be considered to start with an equilibrium, which is changed or disturbed, and reattained at the end of the narrative. *F for Fake* (Orson Welles) is a film that exemplifies the power of narrative, particularly via the opening scene; this in fact consists of only one shot, but continuity editing makes us see the context.

*Aai Shappath* (Gautam Vaze, 2017) is another example of how to build a world and create an atmosphere (in this case, one of fear). This movie uses various techniques to create the impression of fear centering on the child – the focus on the child's face with the Mami blurred out in the background or foreground, the camera staying at the child's eye level, the various "close calls" (as he sees it), the music, etc.

*Juice* (Neeraj Ghaywan, 2017) also uses similar techniques to make the audience understand the situation that leads up to the climax. It uses editing (going between the hall and the kitchen, and the separation of it), the dialogue (politics vs. housekeeping or parenting, and the talk about anatomy), and various plot points (the daughter being made to serve food, the maid not being served in the usual cup). The space in the kitchen is also divided between the host and the guests, who work separately; the lighting is also kept lower in the kitchen compared to the hall. The final shot, having only the cooler and the lady, is also very important – it is the first time her husband actually sees her and understands something (when he lowers his eyes).  
This movie uses a handheld camera, which gives a feeling of nervousness to the viewer, due to its unsteadiness. It also creates an impression of being personally present in the scene, not an omniscient narrator, following the characters around.

# M – Eine Stadt Sucht einen Morder
The film crafts a situation in which we identify with no single character, where an entire city is shown to be living in terror. The setting of a child-killer also sets up a situation where the killer is unambiguously guilty. It forces us to confront the evil of society, and ask how we treat those who are guilty of such crimes. This idea is heavily influenced by the expressionist movement; many shots throughout the movie also recall the expressionist movement. This movie represents a transition between this movement and the noir genre.

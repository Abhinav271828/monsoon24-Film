# Cinema and Tech
In the 40s and 50s, cameras began to be small and light enough to move with the objects in the frame. This enabled the shooting of car chases and Westerns at this time.

Andre Bazin, a French cinema theorist, pointed out that mankind has always wanted to capture reality in as close a likeness as possible. The development of perspective in Renaissance paintings and the parallel use of lighting to define depths in cinema are instances of this.  
An important concept in perspective is the *rule of thirds* – the vanishing point of the image occurs two-thirds of the way into the image (from any side). In cinema, a "good" shot is one that populates two-thirds of the frame.

It is important to note that cinema is the only industrialized art form, depending on huge amounts of labour and technology. Its origins lie in the Industrial Revolution, which is also the root of its connection to the masses (both in production and consumption).  
Cinema is hugely influenced by prevailing technologies, and at various stages in its development it has responded to various ways of consumption – video, television, digitization, OTTs and handheld screens.

In the 80s, the introduction of videography allowed for piracy, and took the money out of theatres. However, liberalization of India's economy led to the popularity of elegance and lavishness depicted in cinema; coupled with the rise of the shopping mall, this revived interest in theatregoing.

One way that cinema has changed is the scale, which is reflected in the aspect ratio. Larger and wider screens allow for more diverse and more impressive visuals (Lord of the Rings). Another purpose of wider frames is to create negative space, defining the setting in some ways. It can also give various details, while at the same time showing the irrelevance of these details.

# Sound
There are several types of sound involved in film:

* location sound: sound recorded during production/filming.
* sound FX: recorded sound added to the location sound in editing (post-production).
* Foley sound: sound recorded live and added to the track to enhance certain aspects of it (Shobdo).

Sound in film can also be classified by its purpose:

* contrapuntal sound: sound that contrasts strongly with the image.
* mickey-mousing: accentuating a diegetic sound with music or sound.
* ambient sound: sound of a location.

Sound also has a perspective, or the sense of its position in space. This is created by volume, timbre and pitch.

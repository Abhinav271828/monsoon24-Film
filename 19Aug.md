# Techniques
## Camera Movements
There are three basic ways of making a moving shot: *zooming* (moving the lens), *tracking* (moving the camera), and *panning* (rotating the camera).

Note that tracking usually refers to movement forward/backward or left/right; up/down movement is called *dolly* (up/down). A dolly-up combined with a track-in is called a *crane shot*.

## Editing
When film was developing as a medium, the American industry began to perfect *continuity editing* to show an uninterrupted sequence of events that is meant to make sense to the viewer. The Soviet industry took up an opposing viewpoint, refusing to allow cinema to be consumed passively, encouraging the viewer to put work into making sense of the shots. Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov are two important filmmakers who adopted this view.

# Citizen Kane
*Citizen Kane* is, among other things, a portrayal of the megalomania of the rich, the obsession with size and extravagance, that we see more and more today.

A constant symbol throughout the film is the snow and the small house, a symbol of Kane's losses in his childhood. This is shown first in the beginning of the movie, with his parents signing the document to give him away; then in his meeting with Susan, out in the snow, with her childish laughter, followed by her own small apartment; and lastly, in the snowglobe that we see in Kane's hand on his deathbed and at the end of his marriage.

The movie also represents the beginnings of tabloid journalism – the opening shot represents the camera trespassing into Kane's private property, past a "No Trespassing" sign, showing him on his deathbed, like journalists invading the privacy of public figures. There is also a correspondence between the way we learn about Kane – through stories told by various people, which we have no reason to trust – and his own vocation of yellow journalism.

The scene where Kane is quarreling with Thatcher about the way he runs the *Inquirer* (after the article on the Spanish war) shows what can be done with a single take. The camera keeps Kane in focus while always moving around, showing very little of Thatcher, and showing people moving in and out of the frame while always emphasising Kane himself. This scene begins to establish Kane's megalomania and childish obsession with money and materials.

# Charulata
The opening scene of *Charulata* depicts an upper-class, restricted housewife, isolated and desperate to explore, for whom time hangs heavy. The emphasis on symbols of lines and bars (her sari, the rails by the passage, the window slats, a literal caged bird) that intervene between the camera and the subject of the shot, represent her enforced seclusion, and her pince-nez is the way she brings the world closer to her while simultaneously showing how isolated she is from it. Noticeably, she uses the same pince-nez to look at her own husband, who walks past her in the passage twice without even looking at her. Her clothing also depicts her modernity, as the form of the sari she wears is a recent innovation compared to the setting of the movie. The opulence and Victorian imagery (Cupid, grandfather clock, the husband's suspenders and pipe) also establish the upper-class nature of the household.

This scene makes use of continuity editing extensively. An example of this is the cut from Charulata looking out of the window to the view itself, seen through the slats. The graphic elements that make up the shot (in this case, the window, the world outside, and Charulata herself) need to be arranged carefully to give the impression of continuity.

Furthermore, the quick and jarring zoom out at the end is an abrupt change from the repetitive, plodding, remaining of the scene. It serves to show what is emphasised by her own expression – a deep anger and frustration with her husband and her life. It also represents her snap back to reality from the world that her pince-nez shows her.

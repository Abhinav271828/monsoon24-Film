# Jump Cuts
When the position of the camera is shifted, there is a perceptible difference if the angle subtended by the new position is more than 30º. If it is less, the shift is not immediately noticeable – thus the action is perceived as continuous – but it creates a jerky effect for the viewers (it makes them jump, lol).

# Continuity vs. Discontinuity Editing
## Броненосец Потемкин (Sergei Eisenstein)
An important element of the Odessa Steps scene in Battleship Potemkin is the fact that elements continually "burst" out of the screen towards the audience, *i.e.*, they move rapidly towards the frame; for example, the white umbrella that opens directly into the camera, and the woman going back to pick up her wounded child running straight towards the camera.

There is also a shot where we see a statue of the Tsar at the top of the stpe,s the soldiers in front of it (as if he is commanding them), and the people trapped between them and the church at the bottom of the steps.  
We also see an elderly lady standing with people crowded around her waist, sitting on the ground, representing Mother Russia.

All these factors contribute towards creating a jumpy, jarring effect for the audience, and is an instance of the discontinuity editing practised by early Soviet filmmakers.

## The Usual Suspects (Bryan Singer)
The opening scene of *The Usual Suspects* is an example of continuity editing, where each cut logically and clearly establishes a sequence of events; for example, the cuts between the POV of the man on the floor and the waistline view of the man with the gun, and the cuts between each shot of the gunpowder fire.
